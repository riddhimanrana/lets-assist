# Email Verification & CAPTCHA Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **CAPTCHA Verification Error on Resend**
**Problem**: When users tried to resend verification emails, the system was getting a "captcha verification process failed" error because `supabase.auth.resend()` was being called without a CAPTCHA token, but Supabase expected one since CAPTCHA was configured.

**Root Cause**: The `resendVerificationEmail()` function wasn't handling the CAPTCHA requirement properly. Since resend requests are server-side without user interaction (no UI to render Turnstile), passing a CAPTCHA token isn't feasible.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `app/signup/actions.ts:resendVerificationEmail()` to gracefully handle CAPTCHA-related errors
- Added specific error codes for different failure scenarios:
  - `captcha_required`: User hit rate limit, needs to wait
  - `link_expired`: Email link has expired, needs to sign up again
- Removed attempts to pass CAPTCHA tokens on resend (not applicable for server-side resend)

### 2. **Expired Email Links Not Handled Properly**
**Problem**: When email verification links expired (after 24 hours), users got a generic error page with no way to recover.

**Root Cause**: The auth callback wasn't detecting and specifically handling the `otp_expired` error code or the "Email link is invalid or has expired" message.

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/auth/callback/route.ts` to detect:
  - `error_code === "otp_expired"`
  - `error_description` containing "Email link is invalid or has expired"
- Created new route: `app/auth/email-expired/` with:
  - `page.tsx`: Server component for handling search params
  - `EmailExpiredClient.tsx`: Client component for UX
- Redirects users to a user-friendly page with options to:
  - Resend verification email
  - Go back to login
  - Sign up with a new account
  - Contact support

### 3. **Improved Error Handling in Signup Flow**
**Problem**: Error messages weren't specific enough for users to understand what went wrong.

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/signup/SignupClient.tsx` to handle new error codes from `resendVerificationEmail()`
- Shows context-specific error messages and actions:
  - For expired links: Offers to sign up again
  - For rate limits: Explains to try later
  - For other errors: Shows generic message

### 4. **Better UX for Email Verification Resend**
**Problem**: The resend button on success page didn't handle specific error scenarios.

**Solution**:
- Updated `app/signup/success/ResendVerificationButton.tsx` to:
  - Detect and handle specific error codes
  - Show appropriate error messages with recovery actions
  - Redirect to signup if link expired
  - Inform users about rate limits

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Resend Verification Email
1. Sign up with a test email
2. From success page, click "Resend Verification Email"
3. Should send new email without CAPTCHA errors
4. Should show success message

### Test Case 2: Expired Email Link
1. Sign up and wait 24+ hours (or manually expire the link)
2. Click verification link
3. Should redirect to `/auth/email-expired`
4. Should show options to resend or sign up again
5. Clicking resend should attempt to send new email

### Test Case 3: Rate Limit on Resend
1. Spam resend button multiple times
2. Should eventually get rate limit error
3. Should show message about too many attempts
4. Should allow user to sign up with new email

### Test Case 4: Unconfirmed Email on New Signup
1. Sign up with email A
2. Try signing up again with same email
3. Should detect unconfirmed status
4. Should offer to resend verification
5. Clicking resend should work without CAPTCHA errors

## Environment Configuration
Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` (optional, but configured)
- `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (optional, but configured)

## Related Supabase Configuration
For production, verify in Supabase dashboard:
1. **Auth Settings**:
   - Email verification: Enabled
   - Email provider: Configured (Resend or SendGrid)
   - OTP expiry: Set to 24 hours (or your preference)

2. **Email Templates**:
   - Confirm signup template: Uses `/auth/callback` redirect
   - Password recovery: Uses `/reset-password/[token]` redirect

## Notes
- CAPTCHA tokens cannot be passed on server-side resend operations
- If Supabase enforces CAPTCHA on resend, users may need to sign up again
- Email OTP links typically expire after 24 hours (Supabase default)
- All error messages are user-friendly and provide actionable recovery paths
