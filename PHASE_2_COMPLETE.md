---

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- ✅ All environment variables configured
- ✅ Database migrations applied
- ✅ RLS policies verified
- ✅ Resend domain verified
- ✅ Test emails successful
- ✅ Build passes locally

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Smoke test on production
- [ ] Monitor error logs (first 24 hours)
- [ ] Test with real institution domain
- [ ] Verify email delivery rates
- [ ] Check middleware performance
- [ ] Monitor consent approval rates

### Rollback Plan
If critical issues arise:
1. Revert middleware.ts (removes route protection)
2. All new pages are isolated (won't affect existing users)
3. Database changes are additive (backward compatible)
4. Can disable DOB/consent checks in middleware

---

## 🎓 Knowledge Transfer

### Key Concepts

**DOB Onboarding**:
- Only triggered for institution email domains
- Calendar picker for ease of use
- Age calculated server-side
- Profile settings applied automatically

**Parental Consent**:
- Token-based, not session-based
- Parents don't need accounts
- 7-day expiration for security
- Can send multiple requests

**Access Control**:
- Middleware runs on every request
- Public routes whitelisted
- Institution detection happens early
- Consent check happens last

### Common Scenarios

**Scenario**: Student enters wrong DOB
- **Solution**: Admin can reset `date_of_birth` field, user repeats onboarding

**Scenario**: Parent never receives email
- **Solution**: Student can send new request, check spam folder

**Scenario**: Consent link expired
- **Solution**: Student sends new request, new token generated

**Scenario**: Student turns 13
- **Solution**: System respects current age automatically

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

- Automated hourly moderation jobs

### Future Ideas
- SMS consent option (Twilio)
- Multi-guardian approval workflow
- Automated age milestone notifications
- Parent portal for consent management
- Consent revocation self-service
