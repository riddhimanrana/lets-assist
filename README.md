## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>What was your inspiration for Let's Assist?</summary>
  <br>
  A: My inspiration for this project actually came from when I went to Santa Cruz Beach and saw a whole ton of trash, scatter all over the beach, and geese getting stuck in it. As I was cleaning up the trash, I thought why don't I make an application so that our whole community can help to clean up something, instead of individual contributions. After I found out about high school volunteering requirements, I knew I could enter a completely untapped market of volunteers to help in their community.

<summary>I thought you said this was a solo project, who are the other contributors?</summary>
  <br>
A: This is a solo project. Essentially as I was in the creation stage of letsassist, I saw a hackathon and I asked my friends if they wanted to come together to help. We created an initial prototype and submitted that but after that the group disbanded. This was an extremely rough first sketch and after the hackathon I deleted all of it and restarted from scratch with a completely new tech stack, new look, redo, and this version is an actually real useable product, with 5 to 10 times more features than the previous one ever did (you can check commit history to confirm this)

  <summary>What makes Let's Assist any different from SignUpGenius?</summary>
  <br>
  A: I created Let’s Assist for two main reasons. First, I wanted an easy way to find and browse volunteering opportunities in my community. Second, I needed a fast, efficient way to track my hours across all projects. Let’s Assist solves both issues because platforms like SignUpGenius aren’t designed specifically for volunteering. By addressing these problems, Let’s Assist enhances the experience for thousands of high school volunteers and improves our community with a more meaningful impact.
